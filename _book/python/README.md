Limitation of Offline ranking metrics [](http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07030)

> To solve these pitfalls, people historically relied on offline ex- periments based on some rank-based metrics, such as NDCG [13], MAP [1] or Precision@K. Such evaluations suffer from very heavy assumptions, such as independence between products or the fact that the feedback (e.g. click) can be translated into a supervised task [10, 16, 22].
